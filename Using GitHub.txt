------- Downloading ("pulling") Project from Github For the First Time -------

1. Ensure that Github Visual Studio Extension is installed (or
   it won't show up).
   
2. There should be tabs at the bottom of the "Solution Explorer" window.
   Click on "Team Explorer" tab
   
3. If the "Connect" screen isn't what it opens up to, click the green "plug" symbol.

4. Under "Local Git Respositories," select "Clone."

5. Enter the following URL where it asks: https://github.com/2017-LSU-Team9/Keyboard_Interface_VS

6. Select a path where you want all the files to go. The folder you place it in will also be title.
   I suggest creating a new one for it in Documents/Visual Studio/Projects/<Name of your choice>

7. Click "Clone."

8. Now the respository should be listed under "Local Git..." with an orange diamond shape 
   preceeding the name. Double Click it and under "Solutions," you should see
   "Keyboard_Interface.sln"  Double click it to open the project in VS.
   
   
   
   
   
------- Uploading ("pushing") Changes Made back to Github -------

1. Save all changes made.

2. At the bottom of VS, you will see an up arrow, a pen symbol,
   and the name of the project. Click the pen symbol (the number beside
   shows the number of files you changed that differ from what's on 
   Github).
   
3. Enter a "commit message" such as "updated" or you can actually summarize what you did 
   in a short sentence(I think you can see it on github site).
   
4. Click "Commit All."

5. A dialog will appear and say that a commit was created locally, "sync to share..."
   Click the word "Sync" in this dialog box.
   
6. Your commit will show under the "Outgoing Commits" dropdown. Click "Push" to upload
   your changes to Github.
   
7. A dialog box will appear and say "Successfully..."
